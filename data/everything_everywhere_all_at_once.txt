(CHUCKLING)

I’m just telling you now in case my mom says something dumb like you’re fat or whatever.

I thought you said when she says shit like that, it means she cares.

Hi, Evelyn.

Mrs Wang!

Hey, Mom.

I only cook enough food for three people.

Now I have to cook more.

It’s Joy. She brought Becky.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

(DOOR OPENS)

JOY: Hi!

Hi, honey!

BECKY: Hi, Mr Wang!

WAYMOND: Hi, Becky! Thank you for coming.

Please call me Waymond. Here, sit.

EVELYN: You know, he doesn’t have to stay.

JOY: Who’s he?

EVELYN: Becky.

Becky’s a she.

(SCOFFS) You know me.

I always mix up ‘he’, ‘she’.

In Chinese, just one word ‘ta’ so easy.

And the way you two are dressed, I’m sure I’m not the only one calling him ‘he’.

I mean her ‘him’. Ugh!

Anyways, my English is fine and we have Google.

So you don’t have to come and be a translator.

You stay here.

(BECKY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

(EVELYN WHISPERING) And she can go.

JOY: Look, I honestly think it’s weird, OK?

But Becky wants to help. Right, Becky?

I always learn something when I hang out with the elderly.

Old people are very wise.

Hmm. It’s OK.

We’ll take Gong Gong with us to the meeting.

Uh, you and Becky stay here and decorate. Hmm?

Where is he? When can I meet him?

(JOY CLEARS THROAT)

Mom, this is literally what it’s always like.

EVELYN: Wrong white paint!

I know you haven’t always liked Becky, OK, but… I like Becky. She is very nice.

You are very lucky…

She’s half Mexican.

(THUDDING)

Ugh!

Huh!

No shoes in washer.

Broken, you pay, yeah?

(SIGHS) But Gong Gong, his heart cannot take it, especially after such a long flight.

You want him to come all the way from China to die like that?

He’s not gonna die.

(WOMAN CHATTERING)

Ooh!

How can I help you?

Just hold on. I can’t hear you.

Just hold on.

How can I help you?

I’m here to pick up some shirts.

I called, like, three times.

Give me your ticket.

Mmm-hmm, yeah.

I find for you.

No, I have the ticket.

MAN: Babe…

She’s just asking for it ’cause that’s, like, the way that it works.

They don’t read minds.

(MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)

Then hang up! Thank you.

JOY: We’ve been together for three years.

Don’t you think Gong Gong would want to know?

Let him enjoy his party tonight.

(JOY SCOFFS) Yeah, you think Becky’s gonna get through the whole party without introducing herself…

(SINGSONG) Evelyn!

JOY: Have you met Becky?

Guess whose $20 got eaten by the machine again.

Waymond! Customers need you!

WAYMOND: Alright, coming!

Evelyn, you know, my wife used to wear that exact same perfume, God rest her soul.

Are you coming to the party tonight?

Yeah, I got my ticket right here.

Sorry. It was too crowded here so I moved some upstairs.

I think the clothes are happier there.

(JOY SIGHS)

(BREATHING DEEPLY)

See? They’re happier here.

No more Google eyes! (MUTTERING)

Mom, can we please talk about Becky?

I still don’t know what his brain is thinking.

JOY: Can Becky come tonight or not?

Stop changing the subject.

I’m not.

You know, it’s like our auditor.

She is a terrible person.

She keeps targeting the Chinese in the community.

(EVELYN SIGHS)

It’s like she can choose – either you come to the party with me and Gong Gong is eternally ashamed until he forgets it all and then he dies or you don’t come with me and then he still dies.

What? Huh!

(MOUTHS)

That was a joke.

Oh, OK.

Well, I was just hoping… that you could explain this.

This is a receipt.

My receipt.

Look, I… I was just hoping you could enlighten me as to how, as a laundromat owner, a karaoke machine could constitute a business expense?

I am a singer.

(SIGHS)

Of course you are.

WAYMOND: It’s true.

She has a beautiful voice. Oh!

Evelyn, sing a song for her.

Shh!

No, no, please.

That will not be necessary.

But I will need a separate Schedule C for each of these businesses because based on what you’re trying to deduct, you’re also a novelist and a chef.

Last time, you told me that…

(TUTTING) Please.

…a teacher, uh, and a singing coach and a ‘Watsu’ technician.

I’m sorry. What… what is ‘Watsu’?

WAYMOND: It’s a water massage.

(EXHALES)

ALPHA WAYMOND: Good. Good.

They don’t know you and I are in this universe yet so, hopefully, I’ll have some time to explain.

I am not your husband. At least not the one you know.

I am another version of him from another life path, another universe.

I’m here because we need your help.

Very busy today. No time to help you.

Shh!

There is a great evil that has taken root in my world and has begun spreading its chaos throughout the many verses.

I have spent years searching for the one who might be able to match this great evil with an even greater good and bring back balance.

All those years of searching have brought me here…

DEIRDRE: Mrs Wang?

..to this universe.

DEIRDRE: Hello?!

To you.

I know it’s a lot to take in right now…

Mrs Wang?!

Hello?

Look, I’m sure you have a lot on your mind, but I cannot imagine anything mattering more than the conversation we are now having concerning your tax liability.

Uh, need I remind you that there is already a lien on your property?

Repossession is well within our rights.

I know. I am paying attention.

Do you see these?

You don’t get one of these unless you’ve seen a lot of bullshit.

Excuse my French.

Now you may… (CLEARS THROAT)

…only see a pile of boring forms and numbers, but I see a story.

With nothing but a stack of receipts, I can trace the ups and downs of your lives.

And it does not look good.

It does not look good.

But…

Uh…

Sorry, my wife confuses her hobbies for businesses.

An honest mistake.

DEIRDRE: Oh! OK.

Well, with all of these, um… “honest mistakes,”

I mean, even if we don’t charge you with fraud, we’ll most certainly have to fine you for gross negligence.

You’re always trying to confuse us with these big words.

(SLOWLY) I thought you were going to bring your daughter to help you translate.

I am going to bring my…

(ALPHA WAYMOND WHISPERING) Hey!

WAYMOND: Sorry.

ALPHA WAYMOND: Evelyn?

She was going to come…

Evelyn! Are you paying attention?

I cannot talk now.

DEIRDRE: She’s too busy to help her parents?

Unless you can help me with my taxes.

(GROANS)

What is “gross necklaces”?

I know you have a lot of things on your mind, but nothing could possibly matter more than this conversation we are having right now concerning the fate of every single world of our infinite multiverse.

DEIRDRE: Where’s the respect for elders?

My dear Evelyn,

I know you.

With every passing moment, you fear you might have missed your chance to make something of your life.

I’m here to tell you every rejection, every disappointment has led you here to this moment.

Don’t let anything distract you from it.

Oh-oh-oh!

You will know when it is time to fight.

You want to redo? You’re going to resubmit?

I will be in contact soon.

Just like the rest of your miserable lives, this is nothing more than a statistical inevitability.

JOBU: Duck.

Duck.

(MUTED AUDIO)

My husband won’t even kill a spider.

How can you be the same person?

ALPHA WAYMOND: You underestimate how the smallest decisions can compound into significant differences over a lifetime.

Every tiny decision creates another branching universe, another…

Were you not paying attention before?

Of course. You’re just very bad at explaining…

Shh!

Don’t push me!

(GASPS) Oh, my God! We have to go back.

We forgot my father!

Don’t worry. We’re monitoring him. He’s safe.

I don’t know. Are you sure?

Yes.

(PEOPLE SHOUTING AND SCREAMING)

MAN: Hey, look, come on!

Look, this is your universe, one bubble floating in the cosmic foam of existence.

Every surrounding bubble has slight variations.

But the further away you get from your universe, the bigger the differences.

This is where I am from, The Alpha verse.

The first universe to make contact with the others.

You can call me Alpha Waymond.

In this world, you were a brilliant woman.

In your search to prove the existence of other universes, you discovered a way to temporarily link your consciousness to another version of yourself, accessing all of their memories, their skills, even their emotions.

Like you with the fanny pack?

Exactly. It’s called Verse Jumping.

“Verse Jumping.”

I need you to learn how to do it right now.

Right now?!

It may be our only chance of getting out of here alive.

Oh, my God, what is going on?

Help us! Help us!

(EXCLAIMING IN MANDARIN)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

How did I die?

I’ve seen you die a thousand ways, in a thousand worlds.

In every single one, you were murdered.

What? Why would anybody want to kill me?

She’s an omniversal being with unimaginable power, an agent of pure chaos, with no real motives or desires.

Jobu Tupaki.

You’re just making up sounds.

(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

Shh!

We need another exit.

So let her destroy the other bubbles.

You said there are so many of them.

(SCOFFS) Maybe it’s OK if we lose some, but just leave me out of it.

It’s not so simple.

She’s been building something.

We thought it was some sort of black hole.

But it appears to consume more than just light and matter.

We don’t know exactly what it is.

We don’t know what it’s for.

But we can all

feel it.

You’ve been feeling it too, haven’t you?

Something is off.

Your clothes never wear as well the next day.

Your hair never falls in quite the same way.

Even your coffee tastes…

…wrong.

Our institutions are crumbling.

Nobody trusts their neighbour anymore.

And you stay up at night wondering to yourself…

How can we get back?

This is the Alphaverse’s mission – to take us back to how it’s supposed to be.

But that begins with finding the one who can stand up to Jobu’s perverse shroud of chaos.

And you think it’s me?

Why else would we risk everything to get you out of here?

BAGEL DEIRDRE: Oh, there you are.

Oh, Miss Deirdre!

I’m sorry I punched you, but…

AUTOMATED VOICE: Calculations complete.

“Profess your love.”

ALPHA WAYMOND: You’re gonna have to profess your love to Deirdre.

(SCOFFS) No way.

It’s your jumping pad.

It’s like eating the chap stick or switching shoes.

We developed an algorithm that calculates which statistically improbable action will place you in a universe on the edge of your local cluster, which then sling shots you to the desired universe.

(MUTTERS IN MANDARIN)

That doesn’t make any sense!

Exactly.

(GASPS)

The less sense it makes, the better.

The Stochastic Path Algorithm is fuel led by random actions.

Tell her you love her and mean it.

Are there any other jumping pads?

The next best paths are break your own arm or take a nap.

You’re not sleepy, are you?

(PEOPLE JOSTLING)

Ow!

Are you with me?

I thought I was disconnected.

Why was I still there?

Your mind, it’s like a clay pot holding water.

Every jump opens another crack, causing things to leak through.

With training, you will learn to reseal these cracks.

Eat. You need energy.

Cream cheese.

Mmm!

In my universe, the cattle were killed off.

One of the many things we’ve lost in our war against Jobu.

Oh, my God.

What if…

…what if I want to go back?

What if I want to go back to the other universe?

(YELLING) Shut it down! Shut it down, you hear me!

Come back!

OK! OK! OK!

I… I’m back!

Listen, you’re only using the other worlds to acquire special skills.

Do you understand?

If you fall for their temptations, you invite contradiction, chaos.

The clay pot could shatter and you could die, or far worse.

What can be worse than death?

We should keep moving until reinforcements come.

No, no, no!

Enough of your clay pots, cream cheese, no cows.

Explain it all to me now.

You’re right.

In the Alpha verse, we began training many young minds to Verse Jump.

But there was one who was far and above the most gifted.

Our little explorer.

You saw her potential… so you pushed her

beyond her limit.

AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning. Unstable.

(HEADSET CHIMES AND POWERS UP)

Now she’s seen too much, lost any sense of morality, any belief in objective truth.

EVELYN: What does she want?

All we know is she’s looking for you.

No! I didn’t do anything. You did it yourself!

I did not do it to myself!

Did you call?

DEIRDRE: It has blood on it!

We’ve detained the assailants. No backup was requested.

Sesame.

Poppy seed.

Salt.

And it collapsed in on itself.

(JOBU CHUCKLING)

‘Cause, you see, when you really put everything on a bagel, it becomes this.

Come on. Run, Evelyn.

You mean the monster that is inside my daughter?

Well, why didn’t you tell me about it earlier?

What else are you Alpha people not telling me?

Did you see her dance that man to death?

There is no way I am the Evelyn you are looking for.

No, I see it so clearly.

See what?

I’m no good at anything.

Exactly.

I’ve seen thousands of Evelyns, but never an Evelyn like you.

You have so many goals you never finished, dreams you never followed.

You’re living your worst you.

I cannot be the worst. What about that hot dog one?

No. Can’t you see?

Every failure here branched off into a success for another Evelyn in another life.

Most people only have a few significant alternate life paths so close to them.

But you, here, you’re capable of anything because you’re so bad at everything.
